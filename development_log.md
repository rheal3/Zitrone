# Status Updates

- 13 July: After much research and many errors I was able to figure out how to save the recipes the user entered so they could view them the next time they opened the app! In order to achieve this miraculous feat I created a function to open a text document write the recipe the user had entered into the text document and close the text document. Now my friends came the real challenge. For low and behold I could not access the material in the text document if the user had the desire to read their recipe and create their scrumptious treat! However, with a tad more googling and many more attempts, this too was solved. When the user wished to read their recipe and typed it into the input I merely opened the desired recipe and used a for loop to read each line to the user. What a marvellous fix. Huzzah!

- 16 July: Today... Today my friend I have take cautionary measures. For unbeknownst to me there were measures to take, but thanks to a wise advisor it was spotted! The recipes saved to the database were being overwritten! Oh the horror! The poor fool who inputted two recipes with the same name would surely be overcome with sadness and woe. And yet. Thanks to this keen eyed advisor the err of my program was spotted and measures have been taken. Now, you may be asking what could be done to prevent this gross occurrence, and I shall tell you: directly under the input for the name of the recipe I added a sneaky little check. Yes! A check. This check would take the potential name of the file and check that the file did not already exist in the desired directory. ~Ingenious I know.~ If (a conditional to the rescue!) the path were to already exist, the program would merely inform the user and they would be given the opportunity to choose a new name for their lavish meal. This, my friend, is my cautionary tail. You can never be too careful, and keep a watchful eye ;)

- 17 July: Implemented viewing recipe from database option into search option. Now the user can search for recipes by ingredient and then view the recipe if they want to make it or get a closer look!

_Reflections:_
- _Realised I need to be a bit clearer with my variable names as they're all rather similar which can be a bit confusing at times._
- _In the future it would probably be best to make code comments from the beginning to help remember what different functions do at a glance. Doing so definitely would have sped up my coding process._
- _I found I didn't really like using the Trello board. It might have just been the way I set it up, but I tended towards my usual method of writing things down for each day. I did like that it provided the opportunity to think through and write down all of the steps that would need to be completed._
- _Testing... I really should have done it more as I was making my app. It became much harder to do it closer to the end after I had already fixed the majority of the bugs and not written any of it down._
- _My code felt a bit messy by the end. I felt like I was repeating things in some places and the code could have been cleaner. This may have been due to my variable names being so alike. For the next app I could write out mored pseudo code and have a clearer flow chart so I have a clearer picture of the overall outcome before I actually start coding._
